# Constructor Pattern

As a JavaScript developer, you may have encountered “constructors” at some point. These are special functions that
initialize objects with specific properties and methods.

The “constructor pattern”, as the name defines, is a class-based pattern that uses the constructors present in the class
to create specific types of objects.

- libraries
- plugins
