# Builder Pattern

The builder pattern is a type of creational pattern that helps in building complex objects using simpler objects. It
provides a flexible and step-by-step approach towards making these objects and keeps the representation, and the process
of creation shielded.

You can use it when building apps that require you to create complex objects. This pattern can help you hide the
construction process of building these objects.

A good example would be that of a DOM, where you might need to create plenty of nodes and attributes. The construction
process can get quite messy if you are building a complex DOM object. In cases like these, the builder pattern can be
used.
