# Structural Patterns

As the name implies, these patterns are concerned with object relationships and the structuring of the class or objects.
They help in adding new functionality without having to modify the entire system. They ensure that if one part of a
system changes, the whole system does not change with it.

The structural patterns we will cover in this chapter include:

- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Adapter Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
