# Facade Pattern

The facade pattern allows you to hide all the messy logic from the client and only display the clear and easy to use
interface to them. This allows them to interact with an API easily in a less error-prone way and without accessing the
inner workings directly.

The facade pattern is used to simplify a clientâ€™s interaction with a system. So it can be used when an application has a
large and complex underlying code that the client does not need to see.

It can also be used when you want to interact with the methods present in a library without knowing the processing that
happens in the background. An example can be of the JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.
